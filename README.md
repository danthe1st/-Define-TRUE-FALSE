# `#define TRUE FALSE`
by dan1st

## Description
Booleans are crazy. Remember the `#define TRUE FALSE` from C?

That is possible in java, too.

Do you not believe me? Try it out.

I even have a game for you.

Do not look at the file `Curser.java` before running it (You can run it in a VM if you don't want to run arbitrary code on your real device).

You can debug `CursedCode` if you don't step into methods of `Curser` to see that it really works.

Now, think how this could be possible.

## Run it

In order to run it, just compile the content of the source directory to another directory and run `io.github.danthe1st.CursedCode` from there.
